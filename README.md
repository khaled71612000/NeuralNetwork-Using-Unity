# Neural Network Using Unity

**Neural Network Using Unity** is a project that demonstrates the use of neural networks to train an AI agent in Unity. The goal is to have the AI learn how to balance a ball on its head through reinforcement learning.

## Key Components

### Scripts
- **BallBalancer.cs:** Manages the logic for the AI agent to balance the ball.
- **NeuralNetwork.cs:** Implements the neural network used for training the AI.
- **TrainingManager.cs:** Handles the training process and manages the learning iterations.

## Features

- **AI Learning:** Utilizes neural networks to train an AI agent.
- **Reinforcement Learning:** Applies reinforcement learning techniques for training.
- **Unity Integration:** Leverages Unity's capabilities for simulation and visualization.
